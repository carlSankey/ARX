Alternate Reality X - Release 0.90.1
----------------------------------

Hello and Welcome adventurer.

This project is now being updated by me.  I'm a hobby programmer (not a great one) and started writing my version of a remake of Alternate Reality back in 2003 using VB6. I never got very far as the graphics were always a challenge to me (and still are). I stopped working on my code for 20 years (am I really that old) and then one day I was reminded of Alternate Reality in conversation with a friend and decided to download some emulators and play it offline (on Android). I was googling around and found this project in GitHub and proceeded to download the release. It was great, but every time I picked something up I was immediately immobilized. I thought to myself that I might be able to fix that. So I downloaded the src code. After a few weeks of messing around with Dev-C++ and other compilers, I eventually made Visual Studio compile and run the src code. An amazing feat to me. At this point, I could step through the code and work out why I was getting immobilized. I found the bug and fixed it. I then started looking at other things and this started to reignite my curiosity about picking this up as a hobby. Yes, like all the great people who have worked on this project (Acrin, Bob, etc)  I have the same goal! What would the other scenarios look like? Would there be any quests like the Dungeon, or would there be different encounters? could I enter the House of Ill Repute and it be open? Lots of things that I still haven't had answers to from the 1980s. So here we are, I have started adding some of the missing things that I can find, Spells, Items, etc. I do this to relax and to give myself a goal when learning C++ and programming in general.

Since the original coder and the last coder has not been able to update the code in about a year.  I've stepped in to see this completed.  There are many bug fixes that has needed to be done and enhancements.  That is what I'm trying to do here.

The source code is under src folder.  You can look at it compile it.  

I will be releasing new versions all the time.  I will post that here.  (I don't have another website to update at present, maybe in future?)

<B>All</b> releases will be under the folder "Releases". I will zip them up there for downloading.

<br/>
If you wish to compile the code, it is located under "SRC".  it has code:block file and a dev-C++ project file.  Also a makefile for gcc is locate there.  You will need to change the libary file pointers to your setup.  

I've not create a step by step instruction on how to compile the code.

Alternate Reality X 
----------------------------------

Alternate Reality X (ARX for short) is a computer role playing game based on the classic 1980s game series by Philip Price. Whilst many features of the original City and Dungeon games are faithfully reproduced ARX is not intended to be an identical copy and contains some new features and differences in gameplay.

Currently you can explore the City and Dungeon levels, visit many of the special locations, have encounters, buy weapons and find treasure but there is still a lot to be added before it will be close to completion.

I'm also planning to add in the originally planned, unfinished scenarios. These include the Arena, the Palace, The Wilderness, Revelation and Destiny. These are a longer term development goal.


I hope you enjoy the game.


Support
---------------------------
If have you any Amiga images from the game that are missing from this version,  please let us know and send them to us, so we can get them into the ARX system.  Many of the Amiga graphics are being used for the 16bit version if you play using 16bit vs. 8bit.  Most of the 8bit is from Atari.

Just create an Issue and attach the graphics to it.  It can just be a screen shot and we can get it into the system.

If you have any of the Amiga songs captured please create an issue and upload the sound file so we can get them into the game.

Thanks for all your support.

Video cards
-----------

Please note that ARX requires OpenGL compliant video card drivers. If you find ARX runs slowly or displays white blocks rather than encounter images then it is likely that your computer is using a generic video driver that comes with Windows rather than the video card suppliers driver.

I've also experienced a number of issues with onboard Intel graphics. Let me know if you experience any display issues, stating the type of video card you have and I'll see if I can resolve the problem or provide a workaround in a later release. I've had no problems with NVidia or ATI/AMD graphics cards. These run ARX very smoothly.
