toast! LEV 3.
by a stairway leading up.
standing before the Gauntlet.
in a narrow room.
in a wide corridor.
in a twisting corridor.
in a bleak room.
in an open area.
in a snaking hallway.
in a filthy tunnel.
in the room of confusion.
in a square room.
in a faintly glowing room.
inside the Gauntlet.
at Death's Door.
in a damp hallway.
inside an abandoned hideaway.
in a long hall.
in a room.
in a seemingly pointless hall.
at the Walk of Arches.
at the Great Dragon's lair.
at a sparkling fountain.
in a small room.
at a stairway leading up.
in a passage.
in a hallway.
in the haven.
facing a fearsome gargoyle.
