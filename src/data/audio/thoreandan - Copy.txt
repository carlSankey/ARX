raise your mug
another jug
relax and stay thru
the night


when you're tired
you shouldn't retire
in bad parts of town
they'll setcha afire
as they burn you
a circle they form
they intend to
stay snug and warm

into danger
entrusting our sword
to ward off dragon
or evil horde
we love danger
and we love our wine
just like treasure
we hope to find


do be kind
to poor and blind
see well out be yond
your eyes
