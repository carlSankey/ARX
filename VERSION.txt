* Added - Sun set and sun rise to 16bit graphics.  It is not done by still graphics. Drawn on the screen based on
		  time.  that way it moves like a real sun.
* Fixed - Ghost information was not correct on armour.  He is suppose to be invulnerable to blunt, sharp weapons.
          you need magical weapons for the most part.  Fixed that.
* Fixed	- put back in the weapon selection for opponent when they attack.  Many opponents have different attacks
          was hard coded to just the first weapon.
* Fixed - Armour ability to handle different weapons is back into the system.  If using a blunt weapon and the

		  vs. encounters alignment  will increase or decrease your chances for more monsters at once.
* Added - Started loading in attributes for weapons. Its loads in weapons that causes curses and dieseases.
          Not active in the code yet. Have not loaded the weapon attributes values into the system yet.  Like
          How long it last.
* Adjust- Adjusted the Treasure finding stats.  Potion should only be in affect until you find treasure and
          then it should go away.  In the code, the treasure just kept getting higher.
          Adjust treasure.  You got a weapon on almost every encounter.  The original game was not like this.  It was much hard to get weapons.  The chances for finding a weapon is much higher now.
* Adjust- Treasure Torch and Keys will not show up in the city anymore.  The city didn't have these items.
          You end up with so many of these items you never have to want for this.

          You get 255xp for each Jewels,  128xp for each Gems
* Fixed - Fixed Weapon damage.   It was calculating weapon damaged wrong.  Way to high.
          It was doing abit check for number of dice and number of sides to the dice.
          This was not correct. a Value of 36 would be 3 dice and 6 sides.  bit check would turn this into 
		  a different value.
          		  
Notes:
	Graphics Mode is now  
		0 - 8bit, 
		1 - 16bit (Amiga),

	set.
